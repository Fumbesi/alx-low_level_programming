The time complexity of a linear search (or sequential search) in an array of size n is O(n) in the worst case. In the worst-case scenario, you would need to iterate through the entire array to find the desired element. This is because you have to compare each element in the array with the target value until you find a match or determine that the target value is not present in the array.

In the best-case scenario, if the element you are searching for is the first element of the array, the time complexity would be O(1). However, the worst-case time complexity is the most commonly analyzed, and it's O(n) for linear search.
